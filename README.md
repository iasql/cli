# IaSQL CLI

The IaSQL CLI executable generated by cargo to use with the [IaSQL engine](https://github.com/iasql/iasql-engine). Installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.iasql.com/install/).

## Releases

For releases call the `.version.sh` script with the appropiate version passed as an argument. If we are on `0.1.31`, do `0.1.32`.

This will trigger the [CI job](https://github.com/iasql/cli/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml). Once the GH CI action runs, you will see a release [here](https://github.com/iasql/cli/releases.
